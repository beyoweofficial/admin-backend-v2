# File Upload Error Fix Documentation

## Problem
The backend was crashing with `MulterError: File too large` when users tried to upload files larger than 1MB, causing the server to stop responding.

## Solution Implemented
I've implemented a comprehensive error handling system that prevents the backend from crashing and provides meaningful error messages to users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Upload Middleware (`middlewares/uploadMiddleware.js`)
- Added proper error handling for multer errors
- Created `handleMulterError` middleware function
- Set file size limit to 1MB (was already there but not properly handled)
- Added logging to track error occurrences

### 2. Updated Route Files
- **Product Routes (`routes/productRoutes.js`)**: Added error handling middleware
- **Banner Routes (`routes/bannerRoutes.js`)**: Added error handling middleware

### 3. Updated Server Configuration (`server.js`)
- Added global error handler as a safety net
- Handles multer errors, validation errors, and general server errors
- Prevents server crashes from unhandled errors

### 4. Created Additional Validator (`middlewares/fileSizeValidator.js`)
- Created additional file size validation middleware (optional to use)
- Provides pre-upload validation capabilities

## Error Responses
The system now returns structured error responses instead of crashing:

### File Too Large Error
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "File too large. Maximum file size allowed is 1MB.",
  "error": "FILE_TOO_LARGE"
}
```

### Too Many Files Error
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Too many files. Please select fewer files.",
  "error": "TOO_MANY_FILES"
}
```

### Invalid File Type Error
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Only image files are allowed (jpg, jpeg, png).",
  "error": "INVALID_FILE_TYPE"
}
```

## Benefits
1. **Server Stability**: Backend never crashes due to file upload errors
2. **User Experience**: Clear error messages help users understand what went wrong
3. **Debugging**: Proper logging helps identify issues
4. **Automation**: Automatic file size validation (1MB limit)
5. **Scalability**: Can easily adjust file size limits or add new validation rules

## File Size Limit
- Current limit: **1MB** for all image uploads
- Applies to: Products images, banner images
- File types allowed: JPG, JPEG, PNG

## Testing
The system has been tested for:
- ✅ Files larger than 1MB (returns error instead of crashing)
- ✅ Invalid file types (returns appropriate error)
- ✅ Too many files (returns appropriate error)
- ✅ Valid uploads (works as expected)

## Usage Notes
- All error responses include a `success: false` field for consistent API responses
- Error codes are provided for frontend handling
- The server will continue running regardless of file upload errors
- Logging is implemented for debugging purposes

## Future Enhancements
- Could add image compression before upload
- Could add progress indicators for large file uploads
- Could implement different size limits for different file types
- Could add file validation based on actual file content (not just extension)
